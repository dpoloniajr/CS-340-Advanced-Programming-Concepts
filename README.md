# CS340 - Advanced Programming Concepts

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To answer the first two questions as one, having a module to call back to as a basis for other work reduces time spent writing code and potential errors. Code is meant for the reader. Therefore, the more the code is optizimed and maintainable, the easier it is for the reader to understand and use. By making the CRUD Python module adaptable, it can be used in the future with other work.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I would approach the problem by analyzing the desired goal and determining what objectives must be completed to get there. Although my approach to the requirements of Grazioso Salvare did not differ greatly compared to previous courses, having a module to call was less work over time that creating code from scratch in every portion of the project. I woud use the same strategy to create databases for client requests, especially if they are similar requests or require the same foundational elements.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Like any scientist, a computer scientist experiments in order to solve a problem. There are times they may face the same or a similar problem and use a previous approach, and in the long run, this reduces the number of times a computer scientist has to create a solution out of nothing. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, this would help to do their work better by using modules to develop efficiencies, which in turn allow them to work on a bigger project or higher quantity of projects.
